Advent of Code 2022
Written in python, see how far we get

Day 1 - borrowed some code from last year to load data from txt file and parse, part 2 involved some sorting and fiddling with data types

Day 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors...

Day 3 - actually easier than I thought - bit of list manipulation

Day 4 - bit tricky spliting the data, but otherwise simple comparisons, probably not the most efficient solution
